# TSP: Finding the shortest pub crawl in Oxford

A solution to the [Travelling Salesman Problem][tsp] can be used to find the
shortest pub crawl around Oxford, but a regular solution wouldn't account for a
key problem: the more you drink, the slower you walk. The goal of this challenge
is to find the shortest pub crawl that accounts for this slowdown, and we may
add some extra restrictions later ;).
